<p>I have a Ph.D. in the Social Sciences and Humanities. I have been teaching for over a decade, and researching Popular Culture while keeping track of the rise and growth of digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. This research on leveraging Bitcoin Cash for humanitarian efforts will be presented at an academic conference in Fall 2018 and further publications will ensue. I'm hoping that my research will make a difference in the perceptions and usages of Bitcoin Cash around the world.

More about me personally: I'm a 30-something married woman that lives in California, spending most of my time working, teaching, reading for fun, and occasionally playing Zelda.  </p>
