<p>I have a Ph.D. in the Social Sciences and Humanities. I have been teaching for over a decade, and researching Popular Culture while keeping track of the rise and growth of digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. This research on leveraging Bitcoin Cash for humanitarian efforts will be presented at an academic conference in Fall 2018 and further publications will ensue. </p>
